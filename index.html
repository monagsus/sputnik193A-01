    <p>Sputnik was the first artifical satellite launched <strong>in 1957</strong> by the Soviet Union. 
      This initial project from the rivaling state at the time would push forward the initiative of American space projects,
      like NASA and DARPA, the latter formerly known as ARPA. <a href="#ff">...FUN FACT</a>
